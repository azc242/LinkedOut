# LinkedOut - Block your toxic LinkedIn feed.
## What is LinkedOut?
A chrome extension that will remove your LinkedIn feed's posts (and replace it with cat pictures instead).

## Why was this built?
One of LinkedIn's most useful features are its abundance of job postings and networking opportunities with recruiters and connections.
This extension was inspired by surplus of job hunters who go on LinkedIn to find job postings but instead see non-fulfilling content or others posting about their massive success. While it is warming to see so many people landing their dream jobs, it can cause users to become dissatisfied with their own careers.
Consequently, this extension was built to better the mental health and well-being of LinkedIn users.
## Here's what your LinkedIn feed will look like
